      <p>
        We are a newly founded project at the University of Leipzig. We are a small team of cineastes who decided in spring 2019 that the University of Leipzig
        urgently needs a university cinema again. And so we started to put our project into practice. So far we can look back on a successful first semester in which we
        were able to present a wide variety of films from all categories to the audience and we were also able to invite some exciting guests for our screenings.
